      <h1>
        <span>Increased search events by 194%</span>
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-down icon"></i>
      </h1>
      <div class="case-content">
        <p><strong>Who:</strong> Technology organization at Comcast</p>
        <p><strong>What:</strong> UX, UI design, implementation of generative AI</p>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> Increased searches by 194% over one year</p>
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>We created a developer specific search engine to ensure developers could easily find the relevant information they were searching for.  
          This meant indexing more sites than those used by the existing company intranet search site and using more dynamic filtering for the 
          returned results.  After the success of our Beta launch, we received so many requests about how to be included in the search results that 
          we added the process to our FAQ page.  This search engine was also the first project I worked on that incorporated generative AI and would 
          serve as the template for future generative AI projects.</p>

        <h2>The Problem: Developers were left searching in the dark</h2>
        <p>The company intranet was optimized for general employee needs - HR content, corporate announcements, etc.  Developer specific sources 
          like Confluence pages were buried or not indexed, making it hard to locate technical resources.  Developers resorted to sharing links 
          manually or bookmarking personal resources.</p>
          
        <h2>Fast Track to Relevant Information</h2>
        <p>Developers had to sift through scattered SharePoint sites and buried content, often relying on bookmarks or shared links to find what they needed.</p>
        
        <p>With the introduction of a developer specific search engine more relevant sources were able to be indexed and filtered to get developers the
          answers they needed in less clicks.  Dynamic filters allowed developers to view results by source and content type reducing time spent searching.</p>
        
        <p>We also wanted to ensure the search experience was similar to other large search engines that users were already accustomed to using.  
          This meant showing search history as you typed your query in the search box, having the ability to hit enter to start the search as well
          as clicking the search icon and viewing results by relevance.  We also ensured the search engine was optimized for use on mobile.</p>

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>I led the UX and UI redesign using Adobe XD to prototype new flows and layouts.  I collaborated closely with engineers to implement 
          React-based filtering, optimized the mobile experience and helped shape the generative AI query integration.  I also participated in daily 
          stand-ups and sprint planning using Jira, helping guide the product from Beta to full release.</p>
        <h2>Design Enhancements I led</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>AI response with cited sources and feedback option</li>
          <li>Lines between results</li>
          <li>Visible URLs</li>
          <li>Enhanced filters</li>
          <li>Decluttered layout</li>
          <li>VPN tags</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="assets/images/vpn tag.png" alt="VPN Tag" class="case-image" />

        <h2>Outcome Statement</h2>
        <p>The creation of a developer specific search tool led to an increase of search events by 194% over the course of one year.  Devs no longer 
          had to rely on a company focused intranet site.  The developer specific search site indexed a broader range of sources, all curated specifically for developer needs.  
          The AI component summarized relevant documents and highlighted key insights with citations, 
          reducing time to information and increasing user trust.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Being a technology organization populated by software engineers led to a greater understanding of what should be returned when searching for 
          information.  We were able to work with the appropriate teams to ensure their valuable data could be indexed, promoted and returned in our 
          search results.</p>

        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>We designed a generative AI widget to answer employee questions about discounted products/services.</p>
        <h2>Outcome Statement</h2>
        <p>Within the first month post-launch, ticket submissions dropped by 30%.</p>
        <h2>Immediate Answers to Questions</h2>
        <p>The AI tool returned sourced responses and supported ongoing Q&A.</p>
        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>I was both PM and UX/UI Designer. I led cross-functional coordination and designed the UI.</p>
        <h2>Mandate</h2>
        <p>The goal was to reduce ticket load while handling authentication and dynamic data. I researched AI tools to guide design.</p>

        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>We analyzed help desk feedback and vendor UX approaches to define foundational principles.</p>
        <h2>Outcome Statement</h2>
        <p>Five principles were defined: intuitive usage, error prevention, reliability, expectation setting, and feedback.</p>
        <h2>Establishing UX as a Requirement</h2>
        <p>52% of negative feedback came from usability issues. Vendor interviews confirmed UX priorities.</p>
        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>I co-led interviews, synthesized findings, and wrote the first draft of the principles.</p>
        <h2>Mandate</h2>
        <p>We aimed to make UX a requirement and embed it in future projects. These principles now guide all new work.</p>
